# sdhash

A Go library implementing the [sdhash](https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash) similarity digest algorithm. sdhash produces compact bloom-filter-based fingerprints of binary data that can be compared to produce a similarity score in the range [0, 100]. A score of 100 means the inputs are identical; a score of 0 means they share no detectable similarity.

This library is a focused implementation of the core digest algorithm. It has no CLI, no index, and no filesystem dependencies. It takes bytes in and returns digest strings out.

## Correctness

This implementation has been verified correct against the C++ reference implementation using a 103,000-file corpus. All 103,000 files match in both stream mode and DD mode.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/your-org/sdhash
```

## Usage

### Computing a digest

```go
data, err := os.ReadFile("sample.bin")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

factory, err := sdhash.CreateSdbfFromBytes(data)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

digest, err := factory.Compute()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Println(digest.String())
```

### Computing a DD (block-aligned) digest

```go
factory, err := sdhash.CreateSdbfFromBytes(data)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

digest, err := factory.WithBlockSize(65536).Compute()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Comparing two digests

```go
score := digest1.Compare(digest2)
fmt.Printf("similarity: %d/100\n", score)
```

### Parsing a digest string

```go
digest, err := sdhash.ParseSdbfFromString(line)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### High-throughput processing

The recommended pattern for processing many inputs concurrently is one goroutine per input. Each `Compute` call produces a fully independent `Sdbf` with no shared state.

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup
results := make([]sdhash.Sdbf, len(inputs))

for i, data := range inputs {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(idx int, buf []byte) {
        defer wg.Done()
        factory, err := sdhash.CreateSdbfFromBytes(buf)
        if err != nil {
            return
        }
        results[idx], _ = factory.Compute()
    }(i, data)
}
wg.Wait()
```

Empirically, using 3-4x the core count as the worker count is optimal because I/O wait time keeps additional workers busy during reads.

## Public API

```go
// CreateSdbfFromBytes returns a factory that will produce a digest from the
// given byte slice. The slice must be at least MinFileSize (512) bytes.
func CreateSdbfFromBytes([]byte) (SdbfFactory, error)

// SdbfFactory builds a digest. Methods return a new factory rather than
// modifying the receiver, making the type safe to share across goroutines.
type SdbfFactory interface {
    WithBlockSize(uint32) SdbfFactory  // 0 = stream mode (default)
    Compute() (Sdbf, error)
}

// ParseSdbfFromString decodes a digest from a wire-format string.
func ParseSdbfFromString(string) (Sdbf, error)

// Sdbf is a computed similarity digest.
type Sdbf interface {
    Compare(Sdbf) int                    // similarity score in [0, 100]
    CompareSample(Sdbf, uint32) int      // score using at most n filters
    String() string                      // wire-format encoding
    Size() uint64                        // total bloom filter data size in bytes
    InputSize() uint64                   // size of the original input
    FilterCount() uint32                 // number of bloom filters
    Fast()                               // fold filters for faster comparison
}

// MinFileSize is the minimum input size required to compute a digest.
const MinFileSize = 512
```

## Wire format

Digests are encoded as self-describing strings. The format is compatible with the C++ reference implementation.

**Stream mode:**
```
sdbf:03:1:-:<filesize>:sha1:<bfsize>:5:7ff:<maxelem>:<bfcount>:<lastcount>:<base64data>\n
```

**DD mode:**
```
sdbf-dd:03:1:-:<filesize>:sha1:<bfsize>:5:7ff:<maxelem>:<bfcount>:<ddblocksize>(:<elemcount>:<base64data>)+\n
```

The name field is hardcoded to `-` with a length of `1`. This library treats digests as pure functions of content: the same bytes always produce the same digest string, regardless of where the data came from or what it was called.

## Modes

**Stream mode** (default) treats the input as a single stream. For inputs larger than 32 MiB, rank and score computation is parallelized across 32 MiB chunks before a sequential bloom filter insertion pass. The insertion pass is sequential to preserve the cross-chunk deduplication behavior that is part of the algorithm.

**DD mode** (`WithBlockSize`) produces one bloom filter per aligned block, enabling block-level similarity comparisons. Each block is processed independently and in parallel. A remainder block is included if it is at least `MinFileSize` bytes.

## Concurrency

Every method on `Sdbf` is safe to call from multiple goroutines simultaneously. `Compare`, `CompareSample`, `String`, `Size`, `InputSize`, and `FilterCount` are read-only and may be called concurrently without restriction.

Each `CreateSdbfFromBytes` call followed by `Compute` produces an independent `Sdbf` instance with no shared state. Computing many digests concurrently across different inputs is safe and is the primary pattern the library is designed for.

**Calling `Fast()` while comparisons are running on the same instance** will cause concurrent `Compare` calls to block until `Fast()` completes. The intended pattern is to call `Fast()` once after construction and before any comparisons, not interleaved with ongoing work.

**`SdbfFactory` is immutable.** `WithBlockSize` returns a new factory rather than modifying the receiver. Sharing a factory across goroutines is safe, though pointless since each `Compute` call produces an independent result.

**SHA1 is the computational bottleneck.** The inner loop computes SHA1 over a 64-byte sliding window at every candidate position in the input. This dominates CPU time. When processing many inputs concurrently the cores stay saturated on SHA1 work. Further within-input parallelism of the SHA1 loop was evaluated and showed no gain when a multi-worker pool is already running at the input level.

## Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
go test -count=1 ./...

# Run with race detector (slower, use in CI)
go test -race -count=1 ./...

# Coverage report
go test -count=1 -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

The test suite achieves 100% statement coverage. It includes regression tests for known issues verified against the C++ reference implementation output.
